<h1>FALL 2017 SKINCARE PRODUCTS</h1>

<p>Today I am planning to introduce you my Fall 2017 favorite winter skincare products. I'm very excited to share it to you!</p>


<img src="skincare1.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:600px;height:600px;">

<p>Okay! I'm going to talk about brands like <i><b>The History of Whoo</b></i> and <i><b>Sulwhasoo</b></i> today.</p>


<p>Some of you may know, <b>The History of Whoo</b> is a well-known Korean skincare brand that combines traditional skincare ingredients from the Korean royal palace with the latest skincare technology. I recently bought a set of their skincare to use because I heard very good feed back about it. The set that I bought has a small travel size Hwahyun Balancer, a small size Bichup Jayoon Cream, Hwanhyun Emulsion, a small and full size Soon Hwan anti-aging essence. </p>

<p>First of all, the packaging is wonderful. When I opened up the box, I felt like I was receiving a gift from Korean royalty, complete with the yellow cloth forming the backdrop of the gift set (yellow is considered to be a royal color in Asia, just like how purple is considered the color of royalty in the Western world).</p>

<p>The Hwahyun balancer acts as a first step on the skin, functioning as a lightweight formula providing moisture after cleansing. Then there’s two essences for you to choose from depending on the state of your skin. The self-regenerating anti-aging (JaSaeng) essence, the company’s best selling product world-wide, is a thick sticky yellow serum that contains ingredients such as cordyceps (a fungus), lotus, and other secret ingredients (I swear, it’s not just because I can’t read Korean. There are secret ingredients that have been passed down from Korean royalty listed in the technical info packet!). The other, the Soon Hwan anti-aging essence, contains tiny microbeads meant to increase circulation in the skin. In my opinion, the self regenerating anti-aging essence is pretty heavy; two pumps is enough for my entire face. It is great for winter months when my skin is so dry and in need of moisture. The Soon Hwan anti-aging essence is great though, perfect for use during any season.</p>

<p>Next, I used the Hwanhyun emulsion as a face cream, and it is also on the thicker side, providing a nice layer of moisture. In fact, when I use the emulsion, the next morning when I wake up my face is glowing as if I had done a face mask the night before! My favorite product in the kit may be the Bichup Jayoon cream though, which I personally use as an eye cream. It contains exotic ingredients such as deer antler collagen, cordyceps, and more, but all that aside, it’s a thick and luxurious cream that works well to hydrate the thin skin around my (tired) eyes.

Overall, I liked that this set contained an entire nighttime skincare regimen, making it easy for me to go through each bottle and not have to think about what else I need. On the whole, the consistency of this line is thicker and heavier, which is better suited for more mature or dry skin. I think this set will become a favorite during the wintertime for me, although I will use the Jayoon cream as an eye cream all year round.</p>

<p>About <b>Sulwhasoo</b>, let’s talk about Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum EX! </p>

<p>Purpose: Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum EX is an anti-aging product that claims to hydrate, balance, and revitalize skin.</p>

<p>Best suited for: All skin types.</p>

<p>Do not use if: You are sensitive to botanical extracts, alcohol, honey, carrageenan, or anything else in the ingredients list.</p>

<p>When and how to use: Pat onto skin immediately after cleansing (or after actives if/when you use those). If you want to feel extra fancy and ladylike while doing so, which I personally do because I want to milk every last drop of raw experience out of the product, check out this Sulwhasoo video for the brand’s recommended application technique.

I don’t particularly believe the patting influences effectiveness, but it feels good, and I like feeling good. Someday I’m going to buy me a pretty floaty dressing gown and a ladylike vanity to complete the experience.</p>
